// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

// My solution

// Take in a name
function greet(name){
    // Return string with name parameter
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`
}
  
// Bob => Hello, Bob how are you doing today?
