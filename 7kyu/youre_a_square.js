// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false

// my solution
var isSquare = function(n){
    if (n < 0){
      return false
    } else {
      return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n))
    } 
}
  
  
// P - a number
// R - true or false
// E - n = 3 => false ; n = 4 => true
// P - First, if the number is less than 0 return false. Next, find square root of number. If number is whole number, return true. If the number is not a whole number, return false.
